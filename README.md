# djack's dotfiles

Just got a new development machine and I'm tired of manually editing dotfiles. 

Also, I want to create an ansible script for easy setup of new machines, so this is a necessary step.

I use mostly default ubuntu settings, but a few things need to get done. Emacs creating tilde files all over the place is a pain, so those are gone. Having the default folders visible in my home directory is distracting, so those get moved. 

that's all for now. More as I remember.
